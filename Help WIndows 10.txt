Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
 was able to get my start menu back with the following steps:

Launch the Registry Editor (hit the Windows key and R, type regedit, and then press Enter) and then navigate to the following key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ ImmersiveShell\Launcher

Click Edit > New > DWORD (32-bit) Value, and name it UseExperience.
Double-click the newly created item and set the value to 0.
Click OK, close the Registry Editor and then restart your computer -- or just restart Explorer. (If you can still right-click on your start button, you can use Task Manager to restart Explorer.)

Source: I reversed the process found in this post about Continuum, the new version of the start menu.
