Hi Raghunandan9,

According to your description, could you please tell me what operation you do and then get the error in the VS2013?

To help you narrow download this issue, I suggest you can try to open your Visual Studio 2013 Tools from your bar and then open the Developer Command Prompt for VS2013. After that, run the following commands:

Try some devenv switches in command prompt:

  a. Run devenv /Resetsettings to eliminate the cause of corrupted settings.

  b. Run devenv /ResetSkipPkgs in Command Prompt.

  c. Run devenv /Safemode to see if you can apply it correctly. This can eliminate the possibility that third party Add-ins or packages are causing problems.
